## Link to RAW data:

(There is no RAW data for some datasets.)

Ways to extract useful data from datasets: 

1-Best way to analyze: Normalize the RAW data

2-Hackish way: Normalize RAW data such that we get the closest possible normalization method to the normalization of the dataset

3-Worst way: Get the average(or sum) of the normalized datas of the control group of both studies, and use this average to get the closest coefficents of normalization.
